# Capstone-Engagement

This is one of the projects from the cyber security bootcamp that I graduated from recently.
It includes the assessment, analysis, and hardening of a vulnerable system.
```
The scenario consisted of:
      - Attacking a vulnerable web server with Kali Linux
      - Viewing that attack traffic in Kibana
      - Recommending alarms for Kibana and various web server hardening methods.
```
